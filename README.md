Pacman Implementation using Processing (Java)
This Pacman game project is written in Processing Java and includes several unique features:

Self-Implemented Shortest Path Algorithm
One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of a self-developed shortest path algorithm. This algorithm is used to calculate the optimal paths for the ghosts to chase Pacman while adhering to the game's rules. It ensures that the ghosts choose the shortest possible routes to catch Pacman, adding an element of strategy and challenge to the game.

Intelligent Ghost Behavior
In accordance with the original Pacman game rules, different ghost types exhibit varying levels of intelligence. The project incorporates simple but effective AI for the ghost characters, making them behave in a manner consistent with the classic game:

Blinky relentlessly pursues Pacman, always aiming to cut him off.
Pinky strategically tries to ambush Pacman by moving ahead of his anticipated path.
Inky exhibits unpredictable behavior, making sharp turns at intersections.
Clyde switches between aggressive and cautious modes, creating an element of surprise for players.

Background Music and BPM Lock
To enhance the gaming experience, this project incorporates background music synchronized with the ghost movements. This synchronization is achieved using the music libraries available in Processing. The beats per minute (BPM) of the music lock the ghosts' movements, making them move in rhythm with the music. This adds an extra layer of immersion and excitement to the gameplay.

Dependencies
This project relies on the Processing Java environment and certain music libraries for BPM synchronization. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
Processing Java
Processing Sound Library

Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic Pacman game and includes elements of game design, AI programming, and music synchronization. It serves as an example of creating an engaging gaming experience with unique features.

Feel free to contribute to the project, report any issues, or suggest improvements. Have fun playing Pacman!
